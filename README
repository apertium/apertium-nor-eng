Norwegian and English

                            apertium-nor-eng
===============================================================================

This is an Apertium language pair for translating between Norwegian
and English. What you can use this language package for:

* Translating between Norwegian (both BokmÃ¥l and Nynorsk) and English
* Morphological analysis of Norwegian and English
* Part-of-speech tagging of Norwegian and English

For information on the latter two points, see subheading "For more
information" below

Requirements
===============================================================================

You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.3.0)
* apertium (>= 3.4.0)
* vislcg3 (>= 0.9.9.10297)
* apertium-nno
* apertium-nob
* apertium-eng (or incubator/apertium-eng_feil for a larger but wronger lexicon)

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: www.apertium.org

Compiling
===============================================================================

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

You can use ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure you're compiling from
SVN. If you're using a --prefix to ./configure, make sure it's the
same one you used to install apertium itself.

Testing
===============================================================================

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following
commands should work:

$  echo "eg er ein fisk" | apertium -d . nno-eng
I am a fish

After installing somewhere in $PATH, you should be able to do eg.

$  echo "eg er ein fisk" | apertium nno-eng
I am a fish

The following command runs tests which are on the Apertium wiki page:

$ ./regression-tests.sh
